# Spotify Clone

As part of learning to code, I completed a project that involved creating a basic Spotify clone using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. This project was designed to showcase my skills in front-end web development, creating a responsive and user-friendly web application that allows users to play music.

The app features basic music playback functionality like play, pause, next, and previous buttons, providing an interactive experience. I used HTML and CSS to design and style the interface, while JavaScript was used to handle user input and interactions such as controlling music playback.

Additionally, I gained experience working with version control tools such as Git and GitHub, which helped manage the project efficiently.

# Tech Stack

HTML: Structure of the web app.
CSS: Styling and layout for responsive design.
JavaScript: Logic and interactivity for playback controls.

# Features

Play/Pause: Allows the user to start or pause the playback of the currently selected track.
Next/Previous: Enables the user to skip to the next or previous track in the playlist or album.
Seek: Allows the user to manually move forward or backward within a track by dragging a slider or clicking on a progress bar.
Now Playing Section: Displays the currently playing song along with its album artwork.
